# LangChain AutoGPT PDF Question Bot Streamlit App
This code is a streamlit web application utilizing Langchain and the OpenAI API, that allows users to upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content. It extracts the text from the PDF, splits it into smaller chunks, creates embeddings for the chunks, and builds a knowledge base. Users can then input a question, and the code uses a question-answering model to find relevant answers from the PDF content. 

### Note
user will need to set up their own .env file with their openAI api token
